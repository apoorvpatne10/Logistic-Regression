# Logistic-Regression

I've got a dataset here which contains user's info in a social network and this social network has various business clients who can put their ads on the social network and one of those clients is a car company which has just introduced a brand new SUV model for a ridicuous price and I'm gonna predict which of the users in the social network are going to buy that SUV based on their given info (salary, age, bla bla).
I'll be making a classifer that will catch the right users into right category, that is, to the ones who are going to buy the suv and the others who aren't.
