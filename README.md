# Logistic-Regression

We've got a dataset here which contains user's info in a social network and this social network has various business clients who can put their ads on the social network and one of those clients is a car company which has just introduced a brand new SUV model for a ridicuous price and we're going to predict which of the users in the social network are going to buy that SUV based on their given info (salary, age, bla bla).
